From today's featured article 
[34mJames Longstreet[39m  (1821‚Äì1904) was a  [34mConfederate general[39m  of the  [34mAmerican Civil War[39m . After graduating from the  [34mU.S. Military Academy[39m  he served in the  [34mMexican‚ÄìAmerican War[39m , where he was wounded. In June¬†1861, he resigned his commission to join the Confederate Army. He significantly contributed to most major Confederate victories in the  [34mEastern Theater[39m , primarily as a  [34mcorps[39m  commander under General  [34mRobert E. Lee[39m . Longstreet's most controversial service was at the  [34mBattle of Gettysburg[39m  in July¬†1863, where he disagreed with Lee and reluctantly supervised several unsuccessful attacks. Afterward, Longstreet was briefly sent to the  [34mWestern Theater[39m , but returned to the east in 1864, where he was seriously wounded by friendly fire, recovered and returned to the field. After the war he worked as a diplomat, civil servant, and administrator. In 1874 he led African-American militia troops  against the  [34mWhite League[39m , an anti- [34mReconstruction[39m  group. Many modern historians consider him among the war's most gifted commanders. ( [34mFull¬†article...[39m )
